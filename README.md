# Rat24S Compiler

## Overview

This Python script encompasses a Lexical Analyzer, Syntax Analyzer, and Intermediate Code Generator for the Rat24S programming language. The script performs lexical analysis to tokenize Rat24S code, then processes it through syntax analysis to check for correct syntax based on Rat24S grammar rules. Additionally, it generates intermediate code (ICG) in assembly language format.

## Usage

To utilize the Rat24S Lexical Analyzer, Syntax Analyzer, and ICG, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the `syntax_analyzer.py`, `lexical_analyzer.py`, and any other required files to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script files.
4. Run the syntax analyzer using the following command:

   ```bash
   python3 compiler.py <input_file> <output_file>
   ```

   Replace `<input_file>` with the path to your Rat24S code file and `<output_file>` with the desired path for the output file generated by the script.

## Functionality

The script provides the following functionalities:

- **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenizes Rat24S code to extract valid tokens and identifies lexical errors.
- **Parsing (Syntax Analysis)**: Processes Rat24S code according to the language's grammar rules to identify syntax errors and generate a parse tree.
- **Intermediate Code Generation (ICG)**: Generates intermediate code in assembly language format based on the parsed Rat24S code.
- **Output**: The script generates detailed output indicating the lexical and syntax analysis results, intermediate code generated, and any encountered errors or warnings.
- **Error Handling**: Provides informative error messages to help identify and resolve lexical and syntax errors in Rat24S code.

## Files

- **`syntax_analyzer.py`**: Main Python script implementing the Rat24S Lexical Analyzer, Syntax Analyzer, and ICG.
- **`lexical_analyzer.py`**: Module for performing lexical analysis (tokenization) of Rat24S code.
- **`tokens.txt`**: Text file containing the tokens extracted during lexical analysis.

## Example

Suppose you have a file named `example.rat` containing Rat24S code. To analyze this code using the script and generate an output file named `output.txt`, run the following command:

```bash
python3 compiler.py example.rat output.txt
```

Check the `output.txt` file for the analysis results, intermediate code generated, and any error messages or warnings encountered during parsing.
